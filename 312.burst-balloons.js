 * Testcase Example:  '[3,1,5,8]'
 *
 * Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a
 * number on it represented by array nums. You are asked to burst all the
 * balloons. If the you burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] *
 * nums[right] coins. Here left and right are adjacent indices of i. After the
 * burst, the left and right then becomes adjacent.
 * 
 * Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * You may imagine nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1. They are not real therefore you can
 * not burst them.
 * 0 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [3,1,5,8]
 * Output: 167 
 * Explanation: nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] -->   [3,8]   -->  [8]  -->
 * []
 * coins =  3*1*5      +  3*5*8    +  1*3*8      + 1*8*1   = 167
