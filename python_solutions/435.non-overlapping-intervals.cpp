 * Medium (41.51%)
 * Total Accepted:    37.4K
 * Total Submissions: 90.1K
 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,2]]'
 *
 * Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you
 * need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start
 * point.
 * Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't
 * overlap each other.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]
 *
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are
 * non-overlapping.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: [ [1,2], [1,2], [1,2] ]
 *
 * Output: 2
 *
 * Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals
 * non-overlapping.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: [ [1,2], [2,3] ]
 *
 * Output: 0
 *
 * Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're
 * already non-overlapping.
 *
 *
 * NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to
 * default code definition to get new method signature.
